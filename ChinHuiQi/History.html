          Games employing <span class="popup">shuttlecocks<span class="popdowntext">A shuttlecock is a high-drag projectile used in the sport of badminton.</span></span> have been played for centuries across <span class="popup">Eurasia<span class="popdowntext">Eurasia is the largest continental area on Earth, comprising all of Europe and Asia.</span></span>, but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate officers of <span class="popup">British India<span class="popdowntext">British India was the collective name for the administrative divisions of British governance on the Indian subcontinent, and in Southeast Asia also termed as the provinces of India, earlier presidencies of British India and still earlier, presidency towns.</span></span> as a variant of the earlier game of <span class="popup">battledore and shuttlecock<span class="popdowntext">Battledore and shuttlecock, or jeu de volant, is an early sport related to modern badminton.</span></span>. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the <span class="popup">Duke of Beaufort<span class="popdowntext">Duke of Beaufort, a title in the Peerage of England, was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester, a descendant of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, legitimised son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, a Lancastrian leader in the Wars of the Roses.</span></span>'s <span class="popup">Badminton House<span class="popdowntext">Badminton House is a large country house and Grade I Listed Building in Badminton, Gloucestershire, England, which has been the principal seat of the Dukes of Beaufort since the late 17th century.</span></span> in <span class="popup">Gloucestershire<span class="popdowntext">Gloucestershire is a county in South West England.</span></span>, but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named <span class="popup">Isaac Spratt<span class="popdowntext">Isaac Spratt was a London toy dealer who wrote pamphlets describing the games of croquet and badminton and was influential in the early development of both.</span></span> published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".
        </p>
        <p>
          The game originally developed in <span class="popup">India<span class="popdowntext">India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia.</span></span> among the British expatriates, where it was very popular by the 1870s. <span class="popup">Ball badminton<span class="popdowntext">Ball badminton is a sport native to India. It is a racket sport game, played with a yellow ball made of wool, on a court of fixed dimensions divided by a net.</span></span>, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in <span class="popup">Thanjavur<span class="popdowntext">The Thanjavur Maratha kingdom ruled by the Bhonsle dynasty was a principality of Tamil Nadu between the 17th and 19th centuries.</span></span> as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

        <p>
          Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of <span class="popup">Poona<span class="popdowntext">Pune, also previously known as Poona, is one of the most important industrial and educational hubs of India, with an estimated population of 7.4 million as of 2020.</span></span>, where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873. By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in <span class="popup">Folkestone<span class="popdowntext">Folkestone is a port town on the English Channel, in Kent, south-east England.</span></span>. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best. The shuttlecocks were coated with <span class="popup">India rubber<span class="popdowntext">Rubber, also called India rubber, latex, Amazonian rubber, caucho, or caoutchouc, as initially produced, consists of polymers of the organic compound isoprene, with minor impurities of other organic compounds.</span></span> and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with <span class="popup">lead<span class="popdowntext">Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb and atomic number 82.</span></span>. Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.
        </p>

          The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the <span class="popup">Bath<span class="popdowntext">Bath is a city in the Bath and North East Somerset unitary area in the county of Somerset, England, known for and named after its Roman-built baths.</span></span> Badminton Club drew up revised regulations. In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules. The <span class="popup">Badminton Association<span class="popdowntext">Badminton England is the national governing body for the sport of badminton in England.</span></span> of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar" in <span class="popup">Portsmouth<span class="popdowntext">Portsmouth is a port and city in the ceremonial county of Hampshire in southern England.</span></span> on 13 September. The BAE started the first badminton competition, the <span class="popup">All England Open Badminton Championships<span class="popdowntext">The All England Open Badminton Championships is the world's oldest badminton tournament, held annually in England.</span></span> for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899.
