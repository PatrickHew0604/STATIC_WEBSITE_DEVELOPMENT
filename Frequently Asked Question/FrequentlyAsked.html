            The APU badminton club prioritizes the safety of our members and
            requires all participants to follow established safety guidelines
            during practices and matches. These guidelines include wearing
            appropriate athletic gear and shoes, using proper technique and form
            during gameplay, and being aware of your surroundings on the court.

            <h5>What equipment do I need ?</h5>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            To play badminton, you will need a few key pieces of equipment. The
            most important piece is a <span id="color">badminton racket</span>,
            which can be purchased from sporting goods stores or online
            retailers. You may also want to consider getting a pair of
            <span id="color">badminton shoes</span> with non-marking soles,
            which can help you move more easily on the court. In addition,
            wearing <span id="color">comfortable athletic clothing</span> that
            allows you to move freely is recommended. The club
            <span id="color">does not provide equipment</span> , so it is the
            responsibility of each member to obtain their own equipment before
            attending practices or matches.

            <h5>Does the club participate in tournaments?</h5>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            <span id="color">Yes</span>, the university badminton club
            participates in various tournaments throughout the year, both within
            the university and outside of it. These tournaments provide
            opportunities for our members to compete against other badminton
            players and clubs, and to showcase their skills. We encourage all of
            our members to participate in tournaments, regardless of their skill
            level, as it is a great way to gain experience and improve your
            game. Information about upcoming tournaments will be communicated to
            members via email and through our website, so be sure to check those
            regularly for updates.
