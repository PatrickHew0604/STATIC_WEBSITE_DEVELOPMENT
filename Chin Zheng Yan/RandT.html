                <h3>Pushing your opponents to the far corner and let them to spend a lot of energy to execute a proper return, especially if they choose to respond to the high serve with a good clear or strong smash.&#10664;</h3>

                <h2>When should you use a high serve&#10067;</h2>
                <h3>A high serve is primarily used in singles play.</h3>
                <h3>A properly executed high serve to the furthest corner from the server puts the opponent in their back court near the edge. This target destination puts demands on the receiver to exert a high degree of energy to produce an adequate return. </h3>
                <h3>A high serve should be used when the opponent does not have the necessary strength or skills to easily return a proper high serve.So, it should not be used for tall players or strong players.</h3>

                <h3>&#10060;You should never use a high serve in doubles&#10071;&#10071;&#10071;  This is due to two (2) primary reasons:</h2>
                <h3>&#x2606; Doubles is all about seizing the offensive and keeping it. A high serve puts the serving team in a defensive situation right off the bat. Furthermore, the service area in doubles is shorter than in singles, which gives the receiving team even more of an edge for a shorter-distanced smash.</h3>
                <h3>&#x2606; A high serve requires a big swing to execute, which will eliminate any element of surprise as the only serve you will be able to deliver is the high serve.</h3>

                <h3>&#x2606;Practice adjusting the angle of the serve.&#x2606; </h3>
                <h3>An important factor to having a strong service game is to refrain from being predictable by the opponents.</h3>
